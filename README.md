### Foundation of a business case
      Together with a local mechanic, I would like to do some statistical analysis with the use of their bills.
      
      With the bills, we can extract a lot of information. This information can be used to produce trends, patteren and more. 
      
      There is a couple of goals I would like to achieve in this project. 
        1. Is to give the local mechanic an overall overview of the kind of repairs they do, the kind of cars they get, and the kind of customers. 
        2. First we can help the local identify the type of customer so they can do a more aggressive ad campaign.
        3. Second we can help the mechanic identify what car parts to buy in bulk, and therefore increase profits. 
        
* What is in the focus of your interest?
The focus here is to do analysis on the customers of the workshop.
Produce usefull statistic to boost the efficiency of ad campaigns and bulk purchases of car parts. 

* Why is it interesting?
      It is interesting because this is a real case, which will help someone.
      It is also interesting because the data we have is not a data set but one excel file per bill.

* Which outcome do you expect from your research?
      We expect the outcome to greatly help the local mechanic, with future pruchases and a more aggressiv add towards his type of customers.

* Who may be a user of the results?
      The user of the result will be the local mechanic
