# Data-Science-Exam

### Foundation of a business case
      Together with a local mechanic who owns a workshop, we would like to do some statistical analysis with the use of their bills.
      
      With the bills, we can extract a lot of information. This information can be used to produce trends, patterns, and more. 
      
      There is a couple of goals we would like to achieve in this project. 
        1. Is to give the workshop an overview of the kind of repairs they do, the kind of cars they get, and the kind of customers they get. 
        2. First we can help the workshop identify the type of customer so they can do a more aggressive ad campaign towards the correct type of customer.
        3. Second we can help the workshop identify what car parts to buy in bulk, and therefore increase profits. 
        
1. What is the focus of your interest?
      1. The focus here is to analyze the customers of the workshop.
      2. Produce useful statistics to boost the efficiency of ad campaigns and bulk purchases of car parts. 

2. Why is it interesting?
      1. It is interesting because this is a real case, which will help someone.
      2. It is also interesting because the data we have is not a dataset but one excel file per bill, so we have to first create the dataset ourselves.

3. Which outcome do you expect from your research?
      1. We expect the outcome to greatly help the workshop, with future purchases and a more aggressive ad campagin towards the correct type of customers.

4. Who may be a user of the results?
      1. The user of the result will be the local mechanic
